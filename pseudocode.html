 <!-- What's the Plan?? How am I going to execute this?

 Layout & Design
    1. Use HTML and CSS To create a visually appealing calculator
        - May have to build skeleton of calculator first... then style as I see fit.
    2. Design the calculator
        - Draw an image of the calculator in coding notebook.
        - Grid in CSS
        - Buttons for numbers, operators, and clear button
        - A form?
        - Must include arithmetic operators, equal sign, clear button
        - RESPONSIVENESS IS SO KEY!!


Functionality (focus more on this, the styling will come)
    1. Implement JS logic to handle user interactions and perform calculations
    2. Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, and Division
        - 4 variables?
    2. Requires user input. 
        - Calculations should be done by "onclick()"
        - Have both keyboard and button functionality
        - Needs display showing what numbers were clicked and typed
        - Reset button (Clear) >> refer to previous project for this functionality.


Error Handling
    1. Handle Scenarios such as division by 0 or any potential errors 
    2. Display Appropriate error messages or prevent invalid operations from occuring
        - How can this be done? Look into this more.

To get a 4...
    1. Addiitonal Functions
        - M+
        - M-
        - MR
        - MC
        - % Calculations
        - Exponents
        - Etc.

    2. History Log
        - Look up how this can be done in javascript
        - this may have to store a variable, or other information.
